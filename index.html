                    <h2>A bit about professional me...</h2>
                    <p> I have 5 years experience as a software engineer, working in both small companies and large
                        organizations.
                        I get up to speed quickly in whatever
                        tech the problem demands and I enjoy being able to quickly master the right tool for the
                        problem. I think the variety of tech in my work history reflects that capacity (needs must).
                        Saying that, I really enjoy creating beautiful, powerful and user-friendly
                        front-ends and
                        aim to grow my abilities in that area in the coming years. </p>

                    <p> At the Irish SME, I
                        developed a cross platform application using Ionic3/Angular5 from scratch. This application is
                        now the
                        flagship app of the company. I also wrote the iOS versions for two small applications. I
                        developed a number of
                        libraries for the company’s .NET backend. I continue to provide maintenance services for this
                        company. </P>

                    <p> I completed a six month contract with King in Barcelona as part of my master's degree.
                        While there I developed the backend API for a new game feature (Java), I also
                        worked on their in-house management tools, using AngularJS and Spring Hibernate.

                    <p> Prior to this, I
                        worked as a data analyst for SSE Airtricity, a role which included data retrieval, task
                        automation and dashboard creation. I developed a web platform
                        for managing regulatory submissions using Python Flask, greatly increasing the ease with which
                        submissions could be managed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2019 I graduated with a <a
                            href="https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=PROG&MAJR=T150">Masters in
                            Computer Science from University College Dublin</a>
                        achieving a GPA of 3.77 (90%).

                    <p>
                        I take courses on topics I feel (I’m rusty on || lacking depth in || want to know more about).
                        <br>I like to keep improving and learning new things.

                    <h4>Design and UX</h4>
                    <p>
                        Good design intrigues me.
                        I’ve recently been reading around the topic to try to understand a bit more about what makes a
                        great design and user-friendly UX.

                    <p>
                        I have a degree in science and I’ve retained an interest in all things scienc-ey.
                        A recovered gamer, I still enjoy reading around games and associated technology and follow a
                        number of different technology websites (<i class="fas fa-heart"></i>
                        Ars Technica).

                        I fell in love with mountains during a trip to the Alps as a young teen and I've been obsessed
                        since. I climb whenever I can and I am a qualified instructor.

                        Angular app to keep track of my ski days this season; I primarily
                        wanted to
                        see if I could create an attractive responsive table.
                        I later used this to create a call logging app for my company.

                        CampusQuest was a gamified fitness app I made while in UCD; marrying my love for sport
                        and games. The best bit was crafting an app from scratch that reflected a bit of me. Super fun.
