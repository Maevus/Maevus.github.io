                    <h2>A bit about professional me</h2>
                    <p> I have 3 years experience as a software engineer, working in both small companies and large
                        organizations.
                        I get up to speed quickly in whatever
                        tech the problem at demands and I enjoy being able to quickly master the right tool for the
                        problem. I think the variety of tech in my work history reflects that capacity (needs must).
                        Saying that, I really enjoy creating beautiful, powerful and user-friendly
                        front-ends and
                        aim to grow my abilities in that area in the coming years. </p>

                    <p> At the Irish SME I worked for, I
                        developed a cross platform application using Ionic3/Angular5 from scratch. This application is
                        now the
                        flagship app of the company. I also wrote the iOS versions for two small applications. I
                        developed a number of
                        libraries for the company’s .NET backend. I continue to provide maintenance services for this
                        company. </P>

                    <p> I completed a six month month contract with King in Barcelona as part of my master's degree.
                        While there I developed the backend API for a new game feature (Java), I also
                        worked on their in-house management tools, using AngularJS and Spring Hibernate.

                    <p> Prior to this I
                        worked as a data analyst for SSE Airtricity, a role which included data retrieval, task
                        automation and dashboard construction using Python, Excel and other in-house tools. I built a
                        web platform
                        for managing regulatory submissions using Python Flask, greatly increasing the ease of which
                        submissions could be managed and dealt with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2019 I graduated with a <a

                            Computer Science from University College Dublin</a>
                        achieving a GPA of 3.77 (90%).

                    <h4>Programming <i class="fas fa-smile"></i></h4>
                    I enjoy reading and I’m slowly working my way through a backlog of programming books.
                    I take courses on topics I feel (I’m rusty on || lacking depth in || want to know more about).
                    I like to keep improving and learning new things.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Design and UX</h4>
                    <p>
                        As an engineer with a focus on front-end, good design intrigues me.
                        I’ve recently been reading around the topic to try to understand a bit more about what makes a
                        great design and user-friendly UX.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Science and Technology</h4>
                    <p>
                        My first degree was in science and I’ve retained an interest in all things scienc-ey.
                        A recovered gamer, I still enjoy reading around games and associated technology and follow a
                        number of different websites on the topic.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Mountaineering / Climbing / Skiing / Mountain biking </h4>
                    <p>
                        I fell in love with mountains during a trip to the Alps as a young teen and they’ve been my
                        passion ever since.
                        I live in the Pyrenees and take advantage of this fact to get out to the mountains during my
                        weekends and whenever I can.
                        This season I completed 40 ski days split between the ski hill and ski mountaineering. I’m also
                        an avid climber and qualified climbing instructor.

                    <p>
                        I created an app in Angular11 to keep track of my ski days this season; I primarily wanted to
                        see if I could create an attractive responsive table.
                        It looks pretty good! I also forked this to create a call logging app for my company.

                    <p>
                        CampusQuest was a gamified fitness app created during my time at UCD as part of a course on
                        Android app development.
                        I worked with some colleagues to bring a vision I had of using games to make fitness fun and
                        interactive to reality.
                        I love sport and I’ve spent many hours playing video games so this was a way to marry those
                        passions.
